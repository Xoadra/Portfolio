### Tech Blog & Portfolio Website


#### This project has been temporarily suspended.

While this app will be the home of my software development portfolio, this website will achieve a far greater scope.  In it, I will include a technical blog detailing my insights and experiences as an engineer within the tech industry.  Most importantly however will be the innovative educational platform geared towards newer developers where I will share my accrued knowledge throughout my career through a series of internally developed, highly interactive interfaces that will allow users to learn technical concepts swiftly and easily.

As I begin to implement versioning on this app, the portfolio and blog will be released at website launch with version 1.0, whereas the educational platform itself is sleighted to be released with version 2.0.

More to come in the future!
